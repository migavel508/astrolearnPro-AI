## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the major challenges we faced was integrating seamless video analysis into the app, specifically extracting relevant text and voice data from video content for educational purposes. We overcame this by combining **Google ML Kit** for OCR with a custom video processing pipeline to ensure accurate content transcription and analysis. Additionally, ensuring fluid interactions in our peer-to-peer SkillSwap network presented difficulties, but we optimized our matching algorithms to enhance user experience.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astrolearn.git
    cd astrolearn
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Set up Firebase:
    - Add your Firebase configuration file (`google-services.json` for Android or `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS).

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
5. We need to start the python flask server for transcripting the text content
